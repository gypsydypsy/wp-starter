== Description ==
**An easy to use visual collaboration tool that clients LOVE! Atarim allows you to collect feedback on your WordPress websites and making design project management a breeze.**

Atarim Visual Collaboration makes it easy and efficient to collaborate on websites with your clients, internal team, contractors…anyone! It's used by nearly 10,000 agencies and freelancers worldwide on over 120,000 websites. 

Need to submit some feedback? Do it straight on the front-end (or back-end) of your WordPress websites without the need to create a task on your project management tool, take a screenshot, upload it, rename it, annotate it, notify your team...and all the other steps required!

### 🚀 What is Atarim & how do I get started?
[youtube https://youtu.be/Yyydw1OM4vI] 
Atarim consistently reduces project and task completion time by more than half, saving literally HOURS from every single day per team member, and removes the agency owner from being the bottleneck of their own business by automating most of the day-to-day work, follow-ups, back-and-forth with clients and internal collaboration within the team. 

### 👩‍🏭👷‍♂️ Who Is This For?
**If you are working on a WordPress website with clients, your team, contractors, your partner...anyone, then this plugin is for you.**

Whether you are a freelancer, a huge agency, or running your own website – our plugin makes collaboration easy.

Atarim can replace project management tools you're already using, eliminating the disorganization that occurs when your feedback, requests, and tasks are all fragmented between 10 different tools - as well as the need to take constant screenshots for annotation and sharing. 

This visual feedback tool slots easily into your workflow, and it automatically takes screenshots, saves user information, minifies images shared by your clients...and so much more!


### 🤯 Start using now for free - forever!

Visually collaborate on as many websites as you want. Our free plan is FREE FOREVER - if it suits your needs you'll never need to pay a penny, log credit card details or watch a single ad! 

**Empower everyone by delivering the ability to leave post-it note like feedback on your live WordPress websites**, getting rid of outdated, time consuming and wasteful forms of communication like emails, Zoom, Slack and the 10 other tools you’re using for project management.

Atarim is a cloud-based app where you can manage all requests that are made on your WordPress websites from one platform, making it the most efficient Wordpress website project management platform to use.

Manage your website projects visually with your clients and team on live, staging and even development websites! And even after the project is finished, Atarim will help get everyone involved on the same page (literally) for your ongoing internal communications around the website.

**Get rid of the crazy long back and forth to get to project completion in a fraction of the time it usually takes and efficiently dealing with post-launch, ongoing requests and feedback!**

### ✅ What Atarim can do for you and your team: 

* **Visually Collaborate**: Enable everyone to leave you visual requests and feedback on live WordPress websites, making tasks like bug tracking and content updates a breeze.

* **Urgency**: Update the urgency of requests, letting everyone know how quickly they need to be completed.

* **Status**: Change the status of a request from “Open” to “In Progress”, “Pending Review” or “Complete” which will be included in a grouped email notification, so you don’t have to ping team members or clients on Slack!

* **Comments Feed**: Requests contain all updates in the comments feed, so everyone knows what’s happening! Updates contain what was changed and who changed it.

* **Automated Screenshots**: Requests automatically generate a screenshot with the current view. See exactly what they see and debug problems easier.
 
* **File Uploads** : Upload images, PDF's and all file types to a request that can then be pushed to the Media Folder with one click, keeping your Media Folder clean.

* **Push To Media Folder**: Automatically optimise images for web and push to the WordPress media folder with one click.

* **Technical Info**: Requests contain technical information like the browser version, screen resolution and the exact page URL about the request creator. So you spend less time debugging and figuring out what the request creator meant.

* **Guest Mode**: Enable anyone visiting your WordPress website to leave requests, perfect for staging websites or the build stage of a project.

* **Auto-login**: Automatically login to all WordPress websites you have installed from the centralised Atarim Dashboard, making project management even easier!

* **One Platform**: Manage all requests from one inbox inside the Atarim Dashboard so you can quickly tackle requests and complex revisions rounds at scale.

* **Grouped Email Notifications**: Instead of filling up your email inbox with many notifications, Atarim groups notifications into easy-to-read and beautiful reports.

* **Back-end Collaboration**: Create requests on any of your WP admin screens, perfect for pointing out things and teaching your clients how to use the WP Dashboard, or having discussions with your internal team.

* **Request Sidebar**: Use the Atarim sidebar to click on requests, taking you directly to them, making feedback easy to find.

* **Request Filter**: Filter the Atarim sidebar to show requests that have a certain status or urgency.

* **Assign WP Users**: Assign WordPress users to requests so they receive notifications about changes.

* **Share Links**: Share requests via link to send to others, which will take them directly to that request on the relevant page, on the WordPress website.

* **Front-end Login**: Use a custom front-end login pop-up when sharing request links on any page. Once logged in, it will keep you on the page, as opposed to the standard WP login which confusingly takes you to the WP Admin Dashboard screen.

* **Additional Email Notifications**: If you need someone to receive grouped notifications outside of the WP website, you can add as many additional email addresses you need.

* **Request Visibility**: Control default request visibility on the website to hide requests if you ever need to.

* **WP User Role Permissions**: Decide which user roles inside your WP website should have access to using visual collaboration.

* **Default Users**: Assign default main client and main webmaster users for automated related workflows.

### 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ Why Should You Use Atarim??
One of the biggest problems we face when working on a website is the constant back and forth that occurs from outdated methods of communication when trying to manage projects.

**78% of website teams and digital agencies confirmed that constant back and forth and confusing communication as being the most common roadblock** when trying to get a project to the finish line, or when generally collaborating on website-related work.

Atarim makes it the easiest it’s ever been to collaborate on a website. Stop using emails and Slack to discuss a website, and start using visual collaboration to make task management a breeze.

Over the past few years Atarim has served thousands of teams and agencies that are collaborating with hundreds of thousands of collaborators, team members, clients, and stakeholders through our platform.

We are now excited to offer our solution for free, to help you and your team get the benefits of visual collaboration, and take your project management and task management to the next level.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is it free? =
Absolutely! The free version of the Atarim can be used with as many websites as you want, with some of the more advanced features of benefit to larger agencies being offered on our premium plans.

= Why do I need to register? =
Registering creates a free account on the Atarim Dashboard.

The reason for this is to stop your WordPress Database being cluttered with all of the requests being made. We store all information securely off-site, very much like Slack, support desks and project management systems.

Your free account acts as the central hub for your communications on as many websites as you want. The registration (or login process if you already have an account with us) allows us to connect this website to your Atarim account.

This will give you access to the entire platform, where you can see all of the websites that currently have the Atarim Visual Collaboration Plugin installed.

One click login, assign team members to requests, reply to requests and a whole lot more...

= How and why is this free? =
Atarim as a whole platform offers some advanced functionality for digital agencies and website teams who are trying to really up their game in project management.

However, the free version gives you everything you need to visually collaborate and start cutting out the crazy back-and-forth that happens when working on a website.

The premium plans just give you a lot more functionality to take it a few steps further!


= How is this reducing 80% of the time it takes to get work done? =
An average basic website project takes between 4-6 weeks (if all goes well), yet we all know that if we have everything we need, building a website on our own takes between 3-5 days.

Where did the extra 2-4 weeks go (84% of the time)?

**We’re tackling the 84% by providing you the clarity that you need to run a successful website team or agency, with each request and empowering the client with a single intuitive tool that they enjoy using.**

= How simple is it to use? =

Atarim is designed to be so easy and intuitive that even your grandma would get it.

You can train your client, team and colleagues with 1 sentence “Please click the + icon and make a request/add your content/give your feedback”.

We even provide swipe copy and video tutorials that you can send your client directly to teach them in 5 minutes how to use our platform.

Also, the first time a WordPress user visits the website after installation, they are shown a pop-up with a tutorial that lasts a few seconds to train them.

= Will this work with my theme & page builder? =
Yes. Atarim is designed to work with any theme or page builder available on the market. 

= Will this work with any website? =
The Atarim Visual Collaboration Plugin will only work on WordPress websites.

However, from the web-based Atarim Dashboard you can use visual collaboration on ANY website, all you need to do is add the URL. Instead of this being on the live website itself, visual collaboration will happen inside the Dashboard!

= What if my clients start adding hundreds of requests? =
Great! Charge them for it 💪
This is the ultimate upsell tool.

What we find is that this will increase your engagement and satisfaction level with your clients but you can expect similar behaviour from them.

Those that reach out often will reach out more, it will take you 20-30% of the time it took before to handle the requests, those that rarely reached out will probably stay the same.

= Should I only use Atarim on new websites? =
We strongly encourage you to add every single website you are working on, regardless of which stage you are at.

For example, use it to work internally with your team on your ecomm website, when gathering content from a client on their brand new project, taking support requests on your care plans etc. It’s perfect for all stages.

= Will you provide support? = 
Yes! For free users, you can request support through the WordPress forum, OR [join our community on Facebook to get the answers you need]( https://www.atarim.io/facebook)

Once you join Atarim on a premium plan, you’re practically part of the family!

You can reach out to us via email or on our live chat with any questions you may have and our team of support engineers and customer care experts will be delighted to provide advice.

= I want to test with a premium plan, can I upgrade after? =
Of course. You can upgrade to any plan at any time, whatever works for you.

= Where do I report security bugs? =

You can report any security bugs found in the source code of this plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment and take care of notifying the developers of this plugin.
